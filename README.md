## Introduction

The AEC industry is undergoing a digital transformation, leveraging data-driven practices to improve efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability. This repository aggregates the best resources to help professionals integrate data-centric methodologies into their workflows.

## Tech Stack Overview

### Data Collection & IoT

Effective data-driven practices begin with robust data collection. In AEC, this often involves integrating various sensors and IoT devices to monitor construction sites and building performance.

- **[Smart Sensors](https://www.sensirion.com/en/)**  
  Sensors that capture real-time data on environmental conditions, structural integrity, and resource usage.

- **[IoT Platforms](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/iot/)**

- **[Drones & UAVs](https://www.dji.com/)**  
  Used for site surveying, progress monitoring, and aerial inspections, providing high-resolution data for analysis.

**Why This Matters:**  
The integration of IoT in AEC enables real-time monitoring and data collection, which are crucial for proactive decision-making. However, the initial investment and the need for specialized knowledge can slow down widespread adoption.

### Data Management & BIM

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is central to managing the vast amounts of data generated in AEC projects.
